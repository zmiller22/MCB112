    "Plotted above are box (top) and swarm (bottom) plots for the expression levels in TPM for ten random genes in both the wild type sandmouse (left) and the corriander knock-out mutant sandmouse (right). For the swarm plots, the color of the dots indicates the sex of the subject. There are ten test subjects for both the wild type and mutant mice. As we saw in the figure from Lestrade's paper, the box plots do not seem to indicate a difference in gene expression levels between the wild type and mutant sandmice. However, looking at the swarm plots on the bottom, there is a clear difference in the expression levels. In the wild type sandmice, the expression levels of each gene have two clusters, clearly clustered by sex. In the mutant sandmice, however, there is much more variability in gene expression levels both accross and within the sexes. Clearly, the expression of these genes is not the same in the wild type and mutant sand mice.\n",

    "Indeed we see that these 5 genes (except for Coriander, which is completely absent in the mutant mice as expected) show distinct sex-based grouping in expression level in wild type mice, but comparitvly massive variation in the mutant mice. \n",

    "## Part 6: Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the plots above, it is clear that the absence in the Coriander gene causes a change in the expression level of other genes in the mutant mice when compared to the wild type mice. I would hypothesize that the expression level of Coriander differs between male and female sand mice, and that expression level mediates the expression level of other genes. In the absence of Coriander gene expression, as is the case in the mutant sand mice, it appears that the expression of other genes is much less tightly regulated, both within and across sexes. Therefore, it does appear to me that the Coriander gene has an effect on the expression levels of other genes in the sand mouse. "
